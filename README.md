Summary
-------
    This project proved to take a lot of time between all memebers of the group. Zac completed the entiriety of Thor by himself (thanks Zac you're the best). After this part was comleted, all of spidey was evenly distributed among the members of the team. Each person wrote certain initial files, but after we got everything to compile, each person manipulated little parts of every file in an effort to combat bugs. We did this by each working in our own repository and if one member fixed a bug, he would push it to the master and the other two would pull the changes in. This worked smoothly due to the fact that we were all with eachother during the completion of the entire project. 

    At first we had a lot of porblems just compiling spidey. We eventually fixed these issues and got all of the helper files to compile with little to no warnings. Hwoever, this did not produce a the server we intended to create. The majority of time spent on this project was spent trying to get features to work correctly. This part of the process went through a lot of trial and error combined with researching info on the related topics. Our largest bug was that when hovering over one of the directories without clinking for a short period of time, the server would produce NULL info for a lot of the request variables. This often caused the program to exit. However, if the program was set to forking mode, the server would just continue to run whenever this happened. Also, if the porgram was run through the student machinces it often di not kill the entire server. However, this was still a very large bug we needed to fix.

Conclusion
----------

Something that we all learned from doing the project in general is exactly how a web server works. The interactions with the client and the server is something we use everyday but up until now, it was not appreciated. There is a lot that goes into hosting a page due to how frequent requests are usually made. Also, I think we all learned how to debug a little better. THe project forced us to really dive into the code and place debugging statements at strategic locations. This is a skill we all know will be valuable in the future as we continue to develop and work on code bases.

Contributions
-------------
Even contribution over every file as a lot of the initial files were changed. We were all with eachother during the entirety of the project discussing each aspect of the code as will tried to fix bugs.
